# PacMen

Description of Project
This program allows creating the unlimited number of PacMen on the screen with a click of a button and make them move across the screen in a random walk bouncing of the screen boundaries. While moving a PacMen opens and closes its mouse. Also, all PacMen move at different random speed and random directions. The program can be run on any computer with a browser making it available for everyone to try and have fun!

How to run:
1. You need to clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open a browser. Any browser should work.
3. Drag and drop an index.html file to your browser
4. In order to add a pacman click on "Add PacMen" and to make it move click on "Start Game"
5. You can add as many PacMen as you prefer. Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements
1. Allow PacMen have different sizes
2. Make PacMen accelerate and decelerate
3. Make PacMen change colors
